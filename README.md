# GUI with PySimpleGUI library
Projects in the repository use PySimpleGUI library to implement several GUI examples as presented in [Clear Code's excellent intro to PySimpleGUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeMaWQZllhg).

## Overview of Projects
Each folder groups a single example as follows:

- [_converter_](./converter/) is the simplest implementation. This project introduces basic components, such as Window, Text and Button. In addition, it shows how to put all these together to make a simple desktop app.

- [_calculator_](./calculator/) introduces theming support, contextual menu and styling. A calculator is implemented to show case.
